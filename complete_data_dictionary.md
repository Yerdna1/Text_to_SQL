## üìã BUSINESS RULES & CALCULATIONS

### Key Business Logic

1. **Qualify+ Definition**: Opportunities in stages: Closing, Design, Negotiate, Propose, Qualify
2. **Call Amount**: Only opportunities with FLM Judgement Indicator = TRUE
3. **Upside Amount**: Negotiate/Propose stage opportunities WITHOUT FLM commitment
4. **PPV Updates**: Refreshed weekly on Mondays with Saturday CoB data
5. **Track Logic**: 4x budget target by Week 1 of quarter, linear buildup from Week -13

### Data Quality Rules

1. **PPV Scaling**: Not recommended at individual opportunity level
2. **Historical Comparison**: Prior year fields enable YoY analysis
3. **Time Dimensions**: Week numbers are relative to quarter start
4. **Geographic Hierarchy**: Country ‚Üí Region ‚Üí Market ‚Üí Geography
5. **Product Hierarchy**: UT30 ‚Üí UT20 ‚Üí UT17 ‚Üí UT15 ‚Üí UT10

## üîç USAGE GUIDELINES

### When to Use Each Metric

- **OPPORTUNITY_VALUE**: Raw pipeline analysis
- **PPV_AMT**: Most accurate revenue forecasting
- **CALL_AMT**: High-confidence committed pipeline
- **QUALIFY_PLUS_AMT**: Standard pipeline health metric
- **REVENUE_BUDGET_AMT**: Target setting and gap analysis

### Aggregation Best Practices

- **PPV**: Aggregate at UT15 x Market level or higher
- **Win Rates**: Calculate at geography/market level
- **Pipeline Coverage**: Use PPV vs Budget for accuracy
- **YoY Growth**: Compare same time periods
- **Weekly Tracking**: Use Qualify+ for velocity analysis

### Common Calculations

```sql
-- PPV Coverage
PPV_AMT / REVENUE_BUDGET_AMT * 100

-- Win Rate
WON_DEALS / (WON_DEALS + LOST_DEALS) * 100

-- YoY Growth
(CURRENT_YEAR - PRIOR_YEAR) / PRIOR_YEAR * 100

-- Pipeline Multiplier
QUALIFY_PLUS_AMT / REVENUE_BUDGET_AMT

-- Weekly Movement
CURRENT_WEEK_VALUE - PRIOR_WEEK_VALUE
```
