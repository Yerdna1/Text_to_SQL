If we’re building an AI chatbot to analyze your sales pipeline, we’d want it to provide fast,
actionable insights and support decision-making. Here’s are some valuable questions the chatbot
should be able to answer:

   •   "What is the total value of deals currently in the pipeline?"
   •   "Show me pipeline by region / industry / lead source / deal size."
   •   "How many deals are in each sales stage?"
   •   "What's the average deal size this quarter?"
   •   "What is the win rate across the team?"
   •   "What’s the forecasted revenue this month/quarter/year?"
   •   "Compare the forecasted revenue to the target (budget) this month/quarter/year?"
   •   "What actions can I take to improve pipeline generation/conversion?"
   •   "Are we on track to hit revenue targets?"
   •   "What’s the current forecast vs actual sales?"
