### ðŸš€ **How It Improves SQL Generation**

#### **Before (Limited Context)**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM PROD_MQT_CONSULTING_PIPELINE LIMIT 10
```

#### **After (Full Knowledge Base)**:
```sql
-- Question: "What's the forecasted revenue this month"
SELECT 
    DECIMAL(SUM(PPV_AMT), 15, 2) / 1000000.0 AS FORECASTED_REVENUE_M,
    COUNT(*) AS OPPORTUNITIES_COUNT,
    AVG(PPV_AMT) AS AVG_DEAL_FORECAST
FROM PROD_MQT_CONSULTING_PIPELINE 
WHERE SALES_STAGE NOT IN ('Won', 'Lost')
  AND MONTH(OPPORTUNITY_CREATE_DATE) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE)
  AND YEAR(OPPORTUNITY_CREATE_DATE) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **Enhanced Capabilities**

1. **Business-Aware Column Selection**
   - Knows PPV_AMT is for forecasting (not OPPORTUNITY_VALUE)
   - Uses proper date filtering for "this month" queries
   - Selects appropriate aggregation levels

2. **Context-Driven Table Joins**
   - Understands when to use PIPELINE vs BUDGET vs ACTUALS
   - Knows relationship between MQT tables
   - Applies proper filtering for business logic

3. **Industry-Specific Terminology**
   - Recognizes IBM sales terms (geography, UT levels, etc.)
   - Maps business concepts to technical columns
   - Understands sales stage progressions

4. **Visual Dashboard Alignment**
   - Generates queries matching dashboard structure
   - Uses same metrics and calculations as visualizations
   - Provides consistent business definitions

### ðŸ“Š **Automatic Knowledge Loading**

The application now **automatically loads** all knowledge base components:

```python
# Loads on startup without requiring file uploads
- âœ… Business questions (questions.txt)
- âœ… Data definitions (Data Dictionaries.txt)  
- âœ… Query examples (chatbot_queries.md)
- âœ… Query explanations (query_explanations.md)
- âœ… Visual context (from dashboard images)
- âœ… Complete data dictionary (when Excel uploaded)
```

### ðŸ§  **LLM Context Enhancement**

Each query generation now includes:

1. **Complete Data Dictionary**: All 216+ column definitions
2. **Business Questions**: Relevant questions from your list
3. **Data Definitions**: IBM-specific terminology and concepts
4. **Query Patterns**: Examples of proven query structures
5. **Table Selection Logic**: Rationale for choosing specific tables
6. **Visual Context**: Dashboard structure and metrics

### ðŸ’¡ **Test the Enhancement**

Try these questions to see the improvement:

1. **"What's the forecasted revenue this month by geography?"**
   - Should use PPV_AMT with proper DB2 date filtering
   - Groups by GEOGRAPHY with million-dollar formatting

2. **"Show me pipeline by sales stage"**
   - Uses proper stage ordering (Qualify â†’ Propose â†’ Negotiate â†’ Closing)
   - Includes both count and value metrics

3. **"Which deals are at risk of being lost?"**
   - Applies business logic for risk identification
   - Uses PPV trends and stage progression analysis

4. **"Compare forecast vs budget this quarter"**
