## üöÄ Demo Results

### Sample Data Overview
- **8 opportunities** across 3 geographies (Americas, EMEA, APAC)
- **$2.33M total pipeline** with $1.9M active pipeline
- **25% win rate** with $430K already won
- **Multiple industries** and deal sizes represented

### Key Insights from Demo Queries

#### Geographic Performance
```
Americas: $1,400K (4 deals) - Leading geography
EMEA:     $500K  (2 deals) - Moderate performance  
APAC:     -      (0 active) - Needs attention
```

#### Sales Funnel Health
```
Propose:   2 deals, $680K - Largest value concentration
Qualify:   1 deal,  $600K - Major opportunity
Closing:   2 deals, $500K - Ready to convert
Negotiate: 1 deal,  $120K - Needs commitment
```

#### Action Items Identified
- üî• **2 large deals** ($1.1M) need acceleration in early stages
- üéØ **2 deals** ($500K) ready to close this quarter
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **1 deal** in Negotiate stage without FLM commitment
