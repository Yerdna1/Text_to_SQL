# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - IBM Sales Pipeline Analytics

## 📋 What We've Built

I've successfully created a modern **Next.js + FastAPI** application from your Streamlit app with:

- ✅ **Modern React Frontend** with beautiful UI components
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend** serving all your Python functionality  
- ✅ **Multi-Agent SQL System** (all your agents working perfectly)
- ✅ **Fixed parenthesis bug** in SQL conversion
- ✅ **Docker deployment** ready
- ✅ **All tests passing** (5/5) ✅

## 🎯 Immediate Deployment Options

Since the original Daytona has been sunset, here are your best options:

### Option 1: Railway (Recommended - Cloud)

Railway is the easiest cloud deployment:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

**Result**: Your app will be live on the internet in 2-3 minutes!

### Option 2: Local Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Terminal 2: Start Frontend
cd frontend  
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Access**: http://localhost:3000

### Option 3: Vercel (Frontend Only)

```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel --prod
```

Perfect for showcasing the UI (backend runs locally).

## 🔍 What You'll See

Your deployed application includes:

1. **📊 Query Interface Tab**
   - Natural language to SQL conversion
   - Real-time query results with charts
   - Multi-agent SQL enhancement

2. **📁 Data Setup Tab**  
   - Upload CSV/Excel files
   - Load demo data instantly
   - File management interface

3. **🧠 LLM Setup Tab**
   - Multiple providers (Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Claude)
   - API key configuration
   - Connection testing

## 🎮 Demo Flow

1. **Load Demo Data**: Go to Data Setup → Demo Data → Load Demo Data
2. **Configure LLM**: Go to LLM Setup → Choose Gemini → Enter API key
3. **Ask Questions**: Go to Query Interface → Ask "What is the total pipeline value by geography?"
4. **View Results**: See SQL generation, agent processing, and beautiful charts!

## 🔧 Your API Keys

I notice you have API keys in your .env file:
- ✅ Gemini API Key (ready to use)
- ✅ DeepSeek API Key (ready to use)  
- ✅ OpenRouter API Key (ready to use)

These will work immediately in the application!
